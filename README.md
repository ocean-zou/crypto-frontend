# Crypto Frontend

Welcome to the Crypto Frontend project! This web application is built using the Next.js framework, TypeScript, Styled Components, and Material-UI. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface to visualize and analyze cryptocurrency data.

- **Styled Components**: A CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components.

- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework that provides pre-designed React components, making it easy to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface.
